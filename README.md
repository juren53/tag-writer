# tag-writer

This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for adding IPTC metadata tags to TIFF and JPEG image files. It uses the Tkinter library to build the GUI and ExifTool to handle metadata operations. The program allows users to select an image file, view and edit existing metadata, and write new metadata to the selected file.

This program is intended as a free form metadata tagger
when metadata can not be pulled from an online database.

- JPEG / JPG
