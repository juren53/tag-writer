# tag-writer

This program creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for adding IPTC metadata tags to TIFF, JPEG and other image files. The program allows users to select an image file, view and edit existing metadata, and write new metadata to the selected file.

This program is intended as a free form metadata taggerwhen metadata can not be pulled from an online database. 

It has been tested against the following file types:

- JPEG / JPG
- TIFF / TIF
- PNG
- [more to come]
