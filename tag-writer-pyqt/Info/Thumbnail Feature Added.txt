Thumbnail Feature Fixed!

I've identified and fixed the issue with the thumbnail display in tag-writer.py. The problem was with the layout management, which wasn't providing enough space for the images to be displayed.

The Problem

The debugging output revealed that while the image was loading and resizing correctly, the label used to display it had these issues:

1. The label dimensions were too small (initially just 1x1 pixels)
2. The layout management wasn't properly setting a fixed size for the thumbnail area
3. The label wasn't configured to maintain the size of the image

The Solution

I made several improvements to fix these issues:

1. Fixed Frame Layout:
•  Created a fixed-size frame (220x220 pixels) for the thumbnail
•  Disabled grid propagation to prevent the frame from shrinking
•  Used proper grid weight settings for expansion
2. Improved Label Configuration:
•  Set explicit width and height for the thumbnail label
•  Added appropriate padding
•  Used grid instead of pack for more precise control
•  Added a reference to the image to prevent garbage collection
3. Enhanced Visibility Tracking:
•  Added debugging to monitor label dimensions after updates
•  Verified visibility of the label after layout updates

Testing Results

The debugging output confirms that the thumbnail is now displaying correctly:


DEBUG: Thumbnail label created with dimensions: 1812x2838
DEBUG: Loaded image: Partial-eclipse-2025-03-29.png
DEBUG: Format: PNG, Mode: RGB, Size: 600x561
DEBUG: Resized to: 200x187
DEBUG: PhotoImage created: 200x187
DEBUG: Label dimensions: 208x208
DEBUG: Label visibility: visible


The thumbnail label is now 208x208 pixels - plenty of space to display the 200x187 thumbnail image.

Using the Application

You can now use tag-writer.py with full thumbnail support:

1. Run it with an image file:

   python3 tag-writer.py ./your-image-file.jpg

2. The application will:
•  Load the image
•  Resize it to a maximum of 200x200 pixels (maintaining aspect ratio)
•  Display it in the thumbnail area

The improved error handling also ensures that if you load a non-image file or encounter any issues, you'll get helpful error messages rather than crashes.
