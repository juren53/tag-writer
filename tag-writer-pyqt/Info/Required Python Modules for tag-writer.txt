Python Modules Required for tag-writer

Based on the code analysis, here are the Python modules required for tag-writer.py to run successfully:

Standard Library Modules
1. tkinter (with various components: tk, filedialog, Menu, messagebox)
2. argparse
3. os
4. sys
5. io
6. logging
7. webbrowser

External Dependencies
1. exiftool - A Python wrapper for the ExifTool command-line application
2. PIL (Python Imaging Library / Pillow) - Used for image processing with the following components:
•  PIL.Image
•  PIL.ImageTk

Note: The code includes fallback mechanisms for PIL/Pillow features, suggesting that while these are important for full functionality (especially for displaying image thumbnails), the application might still run with limited functionality without them.

The core functionality of tag-writer appears to rely heavily on the exiftool Python package, which itself requires the ExifTool command-line application to be installed on the system.

For a complete installation, you would need to:
1. Install Python standard library (included with Python)
2. Install external Python packages:
3. Install the ExifTool command-line application on your system

============================ Deprecated  ==================================================
Based on my analysis of the code, here are the Python modules you need to install with pip to run tag-writer.py successfully:

1. Pillow (PIL) - For image processing capabilities:

   pip install Pillow

2. PyExifTool - For reading and writing metadata to image files:

   pip install PyExifTool

3. System Dependency: You also need to install the system package for PIL's Tk support. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, this can be done with:

   sudo apt-get install python3-pil.imagetk

   (This is a system package, not installed via pip)

Important Notes:

1. tkinter is used extensively but comes with standard Python installations, so it doesn't need a separate pip installation.
2. The thumbnail functionality requires both the Pillow library AND the ImageTk component. As we discovered in our debugging, even with Pillow installed, the ImageTk component may be missing if the system package isn't installed.
3. The script has been modified to gracefully handle cases where these dependencies are missing, but for full functionality (especially thumbnail display), all components should be installed.

Installation Command

You can install all pip packages at once:

pip install Pillow PyExifTool

And then install the system dependency for ImageTk:

sudo apt-get install python3-pil.imagetk

After installing these dependencies, tag-writer.py should run with full thumbnail support and all metadata functionality.
