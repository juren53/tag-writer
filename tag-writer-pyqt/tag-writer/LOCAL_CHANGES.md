# Local Project Restructuring

This document explains the differences between this locally restructured version of the Tag Writer project and the original GitHub repository structure.

## Overview

This local version of Tag Writer represents a comprehensive restructuring of the project to improve organization, maintainability, and adherence to Python best practices. **These changes exist only in this local copy** and have not been pushed to the GitHub repository.

## Key Improvements

The local restructuring includes the following improvements:

1. **Proper Package Structure**: Reorganized the codebase into a proper Python package structure with clear separation of concerns.

2. **Consolidated UI Framework**: Standardized on PyQt6 as the primary UI framework, removing redundant implementations.

3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Created a comprehensive user guide and improved code documentation throughout.

4. **Modern Project Layout**: Adopted a standard Python project layout with proper configuration files (setup.py, requirements.txt).

5. **Improved Testing**: Added basic unit tests to verify core functionality.

6. **Better Resource Management**: Organized assets and resources into dedicated directories.

7. **Cleaner Code Organization**: Eliminated duplication and separated code into logical modules.

## Structural Differences

### Original GitHub Structure
The GitHub repository has a more ad-hoc structure with:
- Multiple implementations mixed together
- Scattered documentation files
- No clear package hierarchy
- Mixing of UI frameworks (wxPython and PyQt)
- Monolithic script approach

### New Local Structure
The local version follows modern Python project conventions:
```
tag-writer/
├── tag_writer/            # Main package directory
│   ├── __init__.py        # Package initialization
│   ├── main.py            # Entry point
│   ├── models/            # Data models
│   ├── ui/                # User interface components
│   ├── utils/             # Utility functions
│   └── resources/         # Application resources
├── docs/                  # Documentation
├── resources/             # External resources
├── tests/                 # Unit and integration tests
├── LICENSE                # License file
├── README.md              # Project overview
├── CHANGELOG.md           # Version history
├── setup.py               # Installation configuration
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
└── run-tag-writer.py      # Development runner script
```

## Merging Changes to GitHub

If you wish to merge these changes back to the GitHub repository, consider the following approach:

1. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch in your GitHub repository for the restructuring:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b restructure-project
   ```

2. **Commit Changes in Logical Groups**: Make commits focused on specific aspects of the restructuring:
   - Package structure changes
   - UI framework standardization
   - Documentation improvements
   - Testing additions

3. **Create a Pull Request**: After pushing the branch, create a detailed pull request explaining the rationale behind the restructuring.

4. **Consider Migration Steps**: In the pull request, document any migration steps users might need to take when updating.

## Making GitHub Match Local Structure

To make the GitHub repository match this local structure, you would need to:

1. **Back Up Important Data**: Ensure any unique functionality in the GitHub version is identified and preserved.

2. **Replace File Structure**: Replace the GitHub repository structure with this new structure.

3. **Update Documentation**: Update all documentation references to reflect the new structure.

4. **Increment Version Number**: Update version numbers to reflect the significant structural changes.

5. **Update Release Notes**: Create clear release notes explaining the changes to users.

## Notes for Consideration

- This restructuring may introduce breaking changes for users who have built workflows around the old structure.
- Consider providing a migration guide if pushing these changes to GitHub.
- The test suite should be expanded before merging to ensure no functionality is lost.
- If both wxPython and PyQt6 implementations are actively used, consider maintaining both but in a cleaner structure.

## Conclusion

This local restructuring represents a significant improvement in the organization and maintainability of the Tag Writer project. While these changes exist only locally for now, they provide a blueprint for potential future improvements to the GitHub repository.
