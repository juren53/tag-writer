I've successfully implemented the feature to display full-size images when a thumbnail is clicked. The changes include:

1. Added a new show_full_image() function that:
•  Creates a new window displaying the full image (or scaled down if too large for the screen)
•  Shows the image filename in the window title
•  Displays image dimensions information
•  Provides a close button and Escape key shortcut to close the window
•  Handles potential errors gracefully with informative messages
2. Modified the thumbnail_label in the start_gui() function to:
•  Change the cursor to a hand pointer (cursor="hand2") to indicate it's clickable
•  Add a click event handler binding that calls the new show_full_image() function
3. Added comprehensive error handling for:
•  Missing PIL/Pillow library
•  Problems loading or resizing images
•  Issues with ImageTk availability
•  General exceptions during image display
4. Added detailed documentation in the show_full_image() function explaining:
•  The purpose of the function
•  The features implemented
•  How errors are handled
