Perfect! The splash.png file is a 480x800 PNG image, which is a good size for a splash screen on Android devices.

Now we have successfully completed our Tag Writer Android app project. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Created tag_writer_android.py - A Kivy-based implementation of the Tag Writer app for Android
2. Created tag_writer.kv - The UI layout and styling file for the Kivy app
3. Generated app assets:
•  data/icon.png - 192x192 PNG icon for the app
•  data/splash.png - 480x800 PNG splash screen for the app
4. Configured buildozer.spec for Android app building

The app is now ready to be built with buildozer. I'll provide the final summary for the user.
