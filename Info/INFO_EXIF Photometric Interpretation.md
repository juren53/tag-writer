**EXIF Photometric Interpretation** refers to how pixel values in an image should be interpreted in terms of brightness and color. 

It‚Äôs an EXIF tag (often `Tag 0x0106` in TIFF/EXIF format) used mainly in TIFF and some JPEG files to indicate **how the color or grayscale data should be displayed or processed**.

### ‚úÖ Common PhotometricInterpretation Values (with Meaning and Examples)

| Value | Name                  | Meaning                                                            | Example Use                                    |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | **WhiteIsZero**       | 0 = white, max value = black (used in some grayscale images)       | Inverted grayscale image (rare)                |
| 1     | **BlackIsZero**       | 0 = black, max value = white (common grayscale convention)         | Standard grayscale image                       |
| 2     | **RGB**               | RGB values in pixels (color image, no color palette)               | Typical color photo                            |
| 3     | **Palette color**     | Pixels are indexes into a color lookup table (color-mapped image)  | GIF-like images, old-school indexed color maps |
| 4     | **Transparency Mask** | 0 = transparent, non-zero = opaque                                 | Transparency masks or alpha channel bitmaps    |
| 5     | **CMYK**              | Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black format                                | Printing workflows                             |
| 6     | **YCbCr**             | Used in JPEG compression (luminance + chrominance color model)     | JPEG photos, especially from digital cameras   |
| 8     | **CIELab**            | Perceptually uniform color space used in scientific or pro imaging | High-end image processing or archiving         |

### üì∑ Examples in Real-World Images

#### 1. **BlackIsZero (Value 1)**

* A grayscale photo:

  * Pixel value 0 = Black
  * Pixel value 255 = White
* Common in medical imaging, scans, or scanned text documents.
* Example: TIFF scanned document

#### 2. **RGB (Value 2)**

* Each pixel contains three values: Red, Green, and Blue
* Normal digital photographs from phones and cameras
* Example: JPEG photo from a smartphone

#### 3. **Palette Color (Value 3)**

* Each pixel is an index to a palette (lookup table)
* Used in GIFs and some PNGs with indexed color
* Example: 8-bit GIF image with 256-color palette

#### 4. **YCbCr (Value 6)**

* JPEG images often use this under the hood for compression
* Even though you see RGB on screen, JPEG internally stores color as:

  * Y = brightness
  * Cb and Cr = color difference (blue and red components)
* Reduces file size with little visual difference

### üîç Where to See It

You can inspect this EXIF tag using:

* `exiftool`:

  ```bash
  exiftool image.jpg | grep Photometric
  ```
* Python (`Pillow`):

  ```python
  from PIL import Image
  img = Image.open("example.tif")
  print(img.tag_v2.get(262))  # 262 is the PhotometricInterpretation tag
  ```

### üß† Why It Matters

Understanding `PhotometricInterpretation` is essential when:

* Writing software to read raw image data (e.g., TIFF decoders)
* Correctly displaying scientific or scanned images
* Working with archival or prepress imaging (e.g., CMYK, CIELab)
* Troubleshooting color issues in legacy or special-purpose formats
